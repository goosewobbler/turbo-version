# Properties

The following properties are defined in the schema:

- `tagPrefix`: A string property that represents the prefix used for Git tags in the project. This property is usually set to the name of the project. `${projectName}@` or just `v` for synced workspaces.
- `preset`: A property that specifies the commit message convention preset used by the commitizen tool in the project. The property is a string with a default value of "angular" and can only take one of the two possible string values - "angular" or "conventional".(Only used if `versionStrategy` is set to "commitMessage").
- `baseBranch`: A string property that represents the Git branch that should be used as the base for versioning in the project.
- `synced`: A boolean property that indicates whether or not the local Git repository is synced with the remote repository.
- `updateInternalDependencies`: A property that specifies how to update internal dependencies between packages. The property is a string with a default value of "patch" and can only take one of the three possible string values - "major", "minor", or "patch". Alternatively, the property can be set to the boolean value `false` to disable automatic updates.
- `skip`: A list of package names that should be excluded from the versioning process. When you specify one or more package names in this list, those packages will be skipped in the versioning process. This is useful when you have packages that don't need to be versioned, or that require additional steps before they can be published.
- `commitMessage`: A string property that represents the commit message pattern used by the commitizen tool in the project. This property is a regular expression. Example: `chore(new version): release version ${version} [skip-ci]` or `chore(${packageName}): release version ${version} [skip-ci]`.
- `versionStrategy`: A string property that specifies the versioning strategy. The property can be set to either "branchPattern" or "commitMessage". By default, it's set to "commitMessage".
- `branchPattern`: An array property that represents the branch name pattern used to calculate the next version. By default, it's set to [`major`, `minor`, `patch`(Applied just when `versionStrategy` is set to "branchPattern").
- `prereleaseIdentifier`: String argument that will append the value of the string as a prerelease identifier `next | beta | alpha ...`
- `skipHooks`: A boolean property that indicates whether the Git commit hooks are run or not.  Defaults to `false`.
