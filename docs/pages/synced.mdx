# Synced

In `synced` mode, all packages in the monorepo or common repo will be updated with the same version and tag. This means that when a new version is released, all packages will have the same version number and git tag. This is useful when you want to maintain consistency across all packages.

- Monorepo example - If you have a monorepo with three packages (package A, package B, and package C), and you release version 1.0.0 in synced mode, all three packages will have the same version number (1.0.0) and git tag (v1.0.0). If you make changes to package A and release a new version (e.g., 1.1.0), all three packages will be updated to version 1.1.0 with the git tag v1.1.0.
- Common repo - If you have a common repo, it will update the package version.

For monorepos `synced` mode is typically used when all packages in the are closely related and should be updated together. However, if you only want to update the packages that have been affected by changes since the last release, you can run the command with `synced=false` or leave it undefined. In this mode, only the packages that have been affected by changes will be updated to the new version.
