# Branch name based versioning

**TurboVersion** uses the Git branch name to determine the next version, by default TurboVersion will use [`major`, `minor`, `patch`] as the branch name pattern, for example, if your current version is 1.2.3, and you have a branch named `patch`, the next version will be 1.2.4 when the `patch` branch is merged into the `main` branch.

## Configuration

To use branch name-based versioning, you need to configure the `version.config.json` file with the following properties:

- `baseBranch` - the main branch name, it's used to calculate the next version.
- `versionStrategy` - the versioning strategy should be `branchPattern`.
- `branchPattern` - the branch name pattern used to calculate the next version (optional, by default, it's [`major`, `minor`, `patch`]).
