# Semantic Commit Messages-based versioning

**Turbo Version** analyzes these semantic commit messages and automatically determines the appropriate version number to assign to the next release of the package. For example, if a commit message indicates that a bug was fixed, **Turbo Version** might increment the patch version number (e.g. from 1.2.3 to 1.2.4). If a commit message indicates that a new feature was added, **Turbo Version** might increment the minor version number (e.g. from 1.2.3 to 1.3.0).

Format: `<type>(<scope>): <subject>`

`<scope>` is optional, but in a monorepo context, it's really helpful to determine the package that you worked.

## Example

```md
feat: add hat wobble
^--^  ^------------^
|     |
|     +-> Summary in present tense.
|
+-------> Type: chore, docs, feat, fix, refactor, style, or test.
```

More Examples:

- `feat`: (new feature for the user, not a new feature for build script)
- `fix`: (bug fix for the user, not a fix to a build script)
- `docs`: (changes to the documentation)
- `style`: (formatting, missing semi-colons, etc; no production code change)
- `refactor`: (refactoring production code, eg. renaming a variable)
- `test`: (adding missing tests, refactoring tests; no production code change)
- `chore`: (updating grunt tasks etc; no production code change)
